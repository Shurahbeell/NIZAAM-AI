You are generating a complete new module for my existing healthcare system located in the project directory I uploaded.

The project stack is:
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Wouter for routing
- TanStack Query v5
- Shadcn/UI + Radix
- Tailwind CSS
- Drizzle ORM (MySQL)
- MCP Multi-Agent Server (Follow-Up Agent, Triage Agent, Knowledge Agent, Emergency Agent)
- Role-based multi-tenant architecture
- Emergency system already implemented
- Facility Finder (Google Places)
- Women’s Health & follow-up modules
- Frontliner Dashboard
- Backend and frontend already integrated with consistent folder structure

I want you to generate **a full new role module: LHW (Lady Health Worker)** integrated with the existing system exactly following the architecture and conventions already inside the project.

### ➤ 1. Add New Role

Add a new role `"lhw"` everywhere the project defines roles:
- auth logic
- role guards
- route gating
- user creation paths if needed
- session metadata

### ➤ 2. Create Complete Frontend Route Module

Create a new route subtree: `/lhw/*`

Add pages under:
`src/pages/lhw/`
- Dashboard.tsx
- Households.tsx
- VisitForm.tsx
- VaccinationTracker.tsx
- EducationHub.tsx
- Inventory.tsx
- Emergencies.tsx

All pages must match the app's:
- shadcn UI styling
- Tailwind tokens
- layout components
- card/table structure
- mobile-first design
- use TanStack Query hooks
- use the same fetch helpers & API patterns
- use same skeleton loaders
- use the existing map components for household map view

Dashboard must show:
- assigned households
- pending visits
- overdue vaccinations or screenings
- emergency alerts
- map of households

VisitForm should allow:
- maternal visit logs
- child growth logs
- chronic disease notes
- text, checkbox, and minimal input interface

VaccinationTracker:
- shows due, upcoming, overdue vaccines
- allows marking completed
- triggers Follow-Up Agent via API

EducationHub:
- shows educational material from Knowledge Agent
- log awareness sessions

Emergencies page:
- send emergency case to Triage Agent
- show timeline/history

Inventory page:
- track vaccine/medicine stock
- request restock

### ➤ 3. Implement Offline Mode

Add an offline queue system under:
`src/lib/offlineQueue.ts`

Features:
- store visit logs, vaccination updates, education sessions, emergencies
- queue items when offline
- auto-sync when online
- integrate with TanStack Query invalidate logic

### ➤ 4. Add Database Tables (Drizzle ORM)

Under `src/db/schema/` create:

1. lhw_assignments.ts
id
lhwId (FK users)
householdId
createdAt

markdown
Copy code

2. lhw_reports.ts
id
lhwId
patientId
visitType
notes
vitals (JSON)
nextVisit
createdAt

markdown
Copy code

3. lhw_vaccinations.ts
id
childId
lhwId
vaccine
dueDate
status
completedAt

diff
Copy code

Use the same naming, conventions, metadata, and timestamps as other tables.

### ➤ 5. Create Backend Endpoints Matching Existing Style

Under `src/server/api/` create:

GET /api/lhw/dashboard  
GET /api/lhw/households  
POST /api/lhw/visit-log  
POST /api/lhw/vaccination  
POST /api/lhw/education-session  
POST /api/lhw/emergency  
POST /api/lhw/sync  
GET/POST /api/lhw/inventory  

Each endpoint must:
- verify session role = "lhw"
- use drizzle queries
- return data in the same format as existing frontliner API
- integrate with MCP Agents

### ➤ 6. Agent Integrations

Add MCP hooks:

Follow-Up Agent:
- send reminders to LHW for missed vaccinations or maternal visits

Triage Agent:
- handle emergency reports from /api/lhw/emergency
- assign nearest hospital
- notify hospital + frontliner chain

Knowledge Agent:
- provide health education content
- log education sessions submitted by LHW

### ➤ 7. UI/UX Requirements

- match existing design guidelines in design_guidelines.md
- calm clinical theme, accessible UI
- minimal input (checkboxes, short text)
- multilingual-ready
- mobile-optimized
- reuse existing components like Cards, DataTable, Badge, Alert, Skeleton, Pagination
- QR-code support for verifying vaccinations or medicine issuance

### ➤ 8. What to Generate

Generate all:
- React components
- UI pages
- Type definitions
- Drizzle schemas
- API handlers
- hooks (useLHWData, useLHWVisit, etc.)
- MCP event handlers
- Offline queue system
- routes in router.tsx
- database migrations if needed

Ensure:
- Everything compiles
- File paths follow exact project norms
- Consistent with existing app modules
- Fully functional LHW module integrated into the system
