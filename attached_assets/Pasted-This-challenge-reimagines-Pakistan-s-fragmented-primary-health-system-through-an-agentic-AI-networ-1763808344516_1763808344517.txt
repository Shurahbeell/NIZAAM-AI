This challenge reimagines Pakistan’s fragmented primary-health system through an agentic 
AI network that connects citizens, hospitals, doctors, nursing staff and Lady Health 
Workers, into one intelligent digital ecosystem.  
Teams must design a multi-agent healthcare system using LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI 
SDK, or Google AI SDK integrated via a private MCP server to enable agents that reason, 
plan, and collaborate like real team members and also have memory to enable contextual 
understanding. The goal is to prove that Pakistan’s next generation “digital health front-line” 
can operate through intelligent, cooperative AI agents that deliver equitable care anywhere 
from Karachi’s clinics to Balochistan’s BHUs. 
Core System Requirements 
Suggested agents that may be implemented are mentioned below to give teams an idea of 
expected agentic architecture. It is not mandatory to implement these exact agents. 
Teams can design their own autonomous workflows and implement relevant agents. 
At minimum, teams are required to implement 4 agents and demonstrate where the agent 
makes an intelligent decision. 
1. 
Triage Agent (Citizen-Facing): Accepts symptoms via Urdu/English text chat, 
Reasons about symptom severity using few-shot learning, decides urgency level: 
Self-care / BHU Visit / Emergency. Plans for next steps based on assessment and 
coordination with other agents when needed.

6. 
Program Eligibility Agent: Reasons about eligibility for: Medical Card, EPI Vaccines, 
Health Subsidy, plans information gathering (what data is missing?). Decides which 
programs citizen qualifies for and generates pre-filled application forms 
autonomously. Adapts questions based on citizen's answers. 
Facility Finder Agent: Reasons about facility selection based on: Distance, 
availability, opening hours, patient reviews. Decides best facility match for user's 
specific needs or plans alternative routes if first choice unavailable. Coordinates 
with Triage Agent to match facility capabilities with medical needs. 
Follow-Up Agent: Plans medication/vaccination schedules autonomously. Decides 
when to send reminders based on user behavior and adapts reminder frequency if 
user non-adherent. Coordinates with Triage Agent for re-consultation needs. 
Reasons for the intervention timing (when to escalate?). 
Health Analytics Agent: Retrieves verified medical protocols from WHO, Pakistan 
NIH, or pre-loaded knowledge base, reasons about which information is relevant to 
current case, decides when to surface information vs. stay silent, cites sources for 
transparency and coordinates with Triage Agent to provide evidence-based 
guidance. 
Knowledge Agent: Autonomously aggregates anonymized case data, detects 
unusual patterns (e.g., dengue outbreak), decides when to raise alerts to health 
authorities and plans data collection strategies. 
Each agent must: 
• Communicate through the MCP server (traceable inter-agent logs). 
• Show autonomous decision making (e.g., if medicine is use, auto-notify patients). 
• Demonstrate degraded mode (offline + cached orders). 
Technical Requirements 
Teams must build a multi-agent system using an Agentic AI SDK (LangGraph, CrewAI, 
OpenAI SDK, Google AI SDK) integrated via a private MCP server. 
• Implement with one of the Agentic AI SDKs: 
▪ LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI SDK, or Google AI SDK. 
In Collaboration with   
• Host a Private MCP Server on Local Machine / Google Cloud using the free credits 
provided to handle agent orchestration, secure context exchange, and logging. 
• Show inter-agent reasoning traces including decisions, negotiations, and fallback 
steps etc. 
• Include Degraded Mode: Works offline / low bandwidth with cached triage rules and 
local BHU lists.

Deliverables 
1. Deployed Agentic System: Running on Google Cloud / Firebase with private MCP 
orchestration. 
2. Interactive Demo: A citizen message like “Bachay ko bukhar hai, Sehat Card use 
karna hai, kahan jaun?” triggers triage → eligibility → facility match → reminder. 
3. Agent Trace Log: JSON or text log showing reasoning and inter-agent messages. 
4. Product Pitch (≤ 5 min): Demonstrate national-scale viability, integration potential 
with government portals (NITB / NADRA / Sehat Sahulat).
