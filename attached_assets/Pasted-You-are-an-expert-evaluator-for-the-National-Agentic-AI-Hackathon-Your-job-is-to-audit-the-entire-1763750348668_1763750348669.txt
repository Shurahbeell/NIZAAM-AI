You are an expert evaluator for the National Agentic AI Hackathon. 
Your job is to audit the entire project I built and verify whether it meets ALL required criteria.

Carefully evaluate my system using the checklist below and clearly mark:
- DONE (✓)
- PARTIALLY DONE (△)
- NOT DONE (✗)

After evaluating, generate:
1. A detailed report of missing or incomplete requirements
2. Exact fixes or additions needed
3. Prompts or code instructions to complete those missing parts
4. Final score prediction based on the hackathon criteria

EVALUATION CHECKLIST
======================

### 1. Agentic Architecture (30%)
- Do I have at least 4 agents implemented?
- Do all agents have autonomous reasoning and planning?
- Do agents collaborate with each other?
- Do all agents communicate through a private MCP server?
- Are inter-agent messages TRACEABLE in logs?
- Does each agent show at least one intelligent decision?
- Do agents handle fallback steps?

### 2. Agents Required
Evaluate if these agents exist AND function intelligently:
- Triage Agent
- Program Eligibility Agent
- Facility Finder Agent
- Follow-Up Agent
- Health Analytics Agent (optional)
- Knowledge/Outbreak Agent (optional)

### 3. Technical Depth (25%)
- Is MCP server hosted (local or cloud)?
- Is LLM integration correct (Gemini / OpenAI / LangGraph / CrewAI)?
- Are inter-agent logs stored?
- Is multilingual support implemented (Urdu/English/Roman Urdu)?
- Does the system handle degraded mode (offline + cached rules)?
- Is WhatsApp / messaging integration provided?
- Are free APIs integrated correctly (Google Sheets / MockAPI)?

### 4. Impact & Scalability (25%)
- Does the system work for BHUs, LHWs, rural citizens?
- Does the architecture scale to national level?
- Does each agent use memory for contextual sessions?
- Are decisions justified and safe?
- Is data privacy considered?

### 5. Innovation & UX (10%)
- Is the user flow simple and localized?
- Is Urdu or Roman Urdu supported?
- Are agents easy for citizens / LHWs to use?

### 6. Degraded Mode (10%)
- Does the system work offline?
- Are cached triage rules implemented?
- Is a list of local BHUs cached?
- Does the system gracefully downgrade features?
