It's great you're looking into accessing health support! When you say "Sehat Program," you are most likely referring to the **Sehat Sahulat Program (also known as Sehat Insaf or Sehat Card)**, which is a major health insurance initiative in Pakistan. There are also provincial variations of these health card programs.

Here's how to understand your eligibility:

1.  **For the Federal Sehat Sahulat Program (Sehat Insaf / Sehat Card):**
    *   **Basic Eligibility:** All Pakistani citizens are generally eligible.
    *   **Prioritization:** The program often prioritizes families listed in the **National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) or Benazir Income Support Program (BISP)**. If your family is registered with BISP, you are very likely covered.
    *   **Universal Coverage in Some Provinces:** In some provinces, like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP Sehat Card Plus), the program has been expanded to offer universal health insurance coverage to *all* residents, regardless of income status.

2.  **For Provincial Health Insurance / Health Card Programs:**
    *   Many provinces have adopted and implemented their own versions of the health card programs, often building upon the federal Sehat Sahulat model.
    *   **Eligibility varies by province:**
        *   Some provinces offer universal coverage to all residents (e.g., KP).
        *   Others may specifically target low-income families or residents of selected districts.
        *   Eligibility generally requires you to be a resident of that specific province.

**To find out your specific eligibility:**

The easiest way to check if you or your family are eligible for the Sehat Sahulat Program is to:

*   **SMS your CNIC number** to the designated short code for your province (this information is often available through provincial health department helplines or websites).
*   **Contact the provincial helpline** for the Sehat Sahulat Program or your provincial health department.
*   **Visit an empanelled hospital** and present your CNIC. The hospital staff can verify your eligibility through their system.

The program aims to provide cashless inpatient health insurance for major procedures, emergency care, maternity, and chronic illnesses, so it's worth checking!
